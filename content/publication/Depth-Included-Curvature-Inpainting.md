abstract = "Depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) is the commonly used for generating additional views for 3DTV and FTV using 3D video formats such as video plus depth (V+D) and multi view-video-plus-depth (MVD). The synthesized views suffer from artifacts mainly with disocclusions when DIBR is used. Depth-based inpainting methods can solve these problems plausibly. In this paper, we analyze the influence of the depth information at various steps of the depth-included curvature inpainting method. The depth-based inpainting method relies on the depth information at every step of the inpainting process: boundary extraction for missing areas, data term computation for structure propagation and in the patch matching to find best data. The importance of depth at each step is evaluated using objective metrics and visual comparison. Our evaluation demonstrates that depth information in each step plays a key role. Moreover, to what degree depth can be used in each step of the inpainting process depends on the depth distribution."
