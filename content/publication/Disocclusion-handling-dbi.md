abstract = "Depth image based rendering (DIBR) plays an important role in producing virtual views using 3D-video formats such as video plus depth (V+D) and multi view-videoplus-depth (MVD). Pixel regions with non-defined values (due to disoccluded areas) are exposed when DIBR is used. In this paper, we propose a depth-based inpainting method aimed to handle Disocclusions in DIBR from V+D and MVD. Our proposed method adopts the curvature driven diffusion (CDD) model as a data term, to which we add a depth constraint. In addition, we add depth to further guide a directional priority term in the exemplar based texture synthesis. Finally, we add depth in the patch-matching step to prioritize background texture when inpainting. The proposed method is evaluated by comparing inpainted virtual views with corresponding views produced by three state-of-the-art inpainting methods as references. The evaluation shows the proposed method yielding an increased objective quality compared to the reference methods, and visual inspection further indicate an improved visual quality."
