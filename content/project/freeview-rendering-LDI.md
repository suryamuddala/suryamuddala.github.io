Three Dimensional Television (3DTV) and Free Viewpoint Television (FTV) are popular technologies for living room environments by providing immersive experience and look around facilities. These technologies required number of view points of data to provide such experience. However, capture and transmission of the required number of views is not a feasible solution. Thus Rendering and Inpainting solutions are provided to generate multiple view.
